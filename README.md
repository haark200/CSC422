# CSC422 Zombie War Program
# Release 1
We first implemented a working project that created an array of random characters, stated how many of each characters were generated and then printed out if any survivors made it or not and if so, how many. The program does the fighting sequence to see if the survivors can beat the zombies or not.
# Release 2
Attack logic was updated alongside print statements showing which characters were attacking who and how much damage was being done. Defender killed was printed when an attack brought someone to 0 health and survivor status printed after combat to see how many survived, if any.
